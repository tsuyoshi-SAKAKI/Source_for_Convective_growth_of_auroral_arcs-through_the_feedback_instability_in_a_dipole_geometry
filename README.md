Data
* fig1: Grid distribution of a flux coordinate system
* fig2: Metric components of two kinds of dipole coordinate systems
* fig3: Distribution of a field-aligned current density perturbation on a meridian plane and snapshots of density perturbations on the ionosphere
* fig4: Color contours of spatio-temporal structures of some quantities
* fig5: Fourier spectra of the density perturbation on the ionosphere
* fig6: Time history of the root-mean-square amplitude of density perturbations

Each simulation data to plot the figures is included in the corresponding file. The data and source code for the linear analysis are separated into three parts, that is, lin_dipole, lin_slab/lconst, and lin_slab/nonuniform.
